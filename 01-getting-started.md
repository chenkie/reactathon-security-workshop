# Module 1 - Getting Started

The goal for this workshop is to get you up to speed with how to think and reason about user authentication and authorization in a React application. To do that, we'll work from a demo app called Orbit.

Orbit contains two parts: the React front end and the Node backend. In the Orbit repo, these are found in the **orbit-app** and **orbit-api** folders respectively.

## Exercise Instructions

**Prerequisites**

- Make sure you are on the `master` branch in the Orbit repo.
- Ensure you have followed the instructions in the readme for the Orbit repo and that you have all dependencies installed and values populated in the `.env` file for the Node API.

**Exercise Steps**

Create a user account by going to the signup page a `http://localhost:3000/signup`.

Once you're in, tour the application to get a sense of how it works and its various parts.
